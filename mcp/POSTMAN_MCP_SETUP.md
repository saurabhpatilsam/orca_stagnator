## 🔗 Integration with Your API Documentation

Since you just created comprehensive API documentation with Postman collections:

```bash
api-documentation/
├── postman-collections/
│   ├── 1-internal-backend-apis.json     ← Can import to Postman
│   ├── 2-tradovate-apis.json           ← Can import to Postman
│   ├── 3-supabase-edge-functions.json  ← Can import to Postman
│   └── 4-redis-operations.json         ← Can import to Postman
```

**With Postman MCP, you can:**
1. Import these collections to your Postman workspace
2. Access them directly from Windsurf
3. Run tests without leaving your IDE
4. Sync changes between Windsurf and Postman

## 📋 Postman MCP Configuration

**Server Details:**
```json
{
  "postman": {
    "type": "http",
    "url": "https://mcp.postman.com/mcp",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer ${POSTMAN_API_KEY}"
    },
    "description": "Postman MCP server for API testing and collection management"
  }
}
```

**Note:** Using full mode (`/mcp`). If you need minimal mode, change URL to:
```
"url": "https://mcp.postman.com/minimal"
```

For EU region:
```
"url": "https://mcp.eu.postman.com/mcp"
```

---

## ✅ Verification

After restart, verify Postman MCP is loaded:

1. Open Windsurf MCP panel
2. Look for "postman" in the server list
3. Should show ✅ Connected status
4. Try accessing your Postman collections

---

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit your API key** - `.env` is already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use workspace-specific keys** - Create separate keys for different projects
3. **Rotate keys regularly** - Regenerate keys every 90 days
4. **Monitor usage** - Check Postman dashboard for API key activity
5. **Revoke unused keys** - Delete old keys you're not using

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" Error
- Check API key is correct (no spaces)
- Verify key has necessary permissions in Postman
- Try regenerating the key

### Server Not Loading
- Ensure `.env` file is saved
- Restart Windsurf completely
- Check Windsurf logs for errors

### Can't Find Collections
- Verify collections exist in your Postman workspace
- Check workspace permissions
- Try refreshing MCP connection
