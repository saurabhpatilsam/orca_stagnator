## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps (20 minutes)

### **STEP 1: Deploy Backend to Railway** (10 min)

```bash
# 1. Go to https://railway.app and sign up
# 2. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
# 3. Connect your GitHub account
# 4. Select this repository
# 5. Railway will auto-deploy!

# 6. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard:
SUPABASE_URL=https://dcoukhtfcloqpfmijock.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
PORT=8000

# 7. Generate domain in Railway → Settings → Generate Domain
# 8. Copy the URL (e.g., https://csv-upload-api-production.up.railway.app)
```

**✅ Backend is live!**

---

### **STEP 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel** (5 min)

```bash
# 1. Update API URL with your Railway URL
cd /Users/stagnator/Downloads/orca-ven-backend-main

# 2. Run deployment script
./deploy.sh https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app

# This will:
# - Update API URL in frontend
# - Install dependencies
# - Build frontend
# - Deploy to Vercel

# 3. When Vercel prompts:
# - Login with GitHub
# - Project name: csv-upload-frontend
# - Deploy!
```

**✅ Frontend is live!**

### **STEP 3: Configure Domain** (5 min)

#### **In Vercel Dashboard:**

1. Go to your project → Settings → Domains
2. Add domain: `www.infignity.com`
3. Vercel will show DNS records

#### **In Hostinger (hpanel.hostinger.com):**

1. Go to Domains → infignity.com → DNS Zone
2. Add CNAME record:
   ```
   Type: CNAME
   Name: www
   Points to: cname.vercel-dns.com
   TTL: 3600
   ```
3. Save

#### **Wait 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Backend not responding:**
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Or in Railway dashboard → Logs

# Verify environment variables are set
# Verify PORT is set to 8000
```

### **Frontend CORS error:**
```bash
# In Railway dashboard → Variables
# Add or update:
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://www.infignity.com,https://csv-upload-frontend.vercel.app

# Redeploy backend
```

### **Domain not working:**
```bash
# Check DNS propagation
https://dnschecker.org

# Verify CNAME record in Hostinger
# Wait 5-60 minutes for DNS to update

# Use Vercel URL temporarily:
https://csv-upload-frontend.vercel.app
```

### **Upload fails:**
```bash
# Open browser console (F12)
# Check for errors
# Verify API_URL in frontend/src/config.js
